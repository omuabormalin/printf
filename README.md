This is ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project

This team project is a customized printf function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We submitted this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading.

The task involve step by step include:

0 - Writes a function that produces output according to a format.

1 - Handle the following conversion specifiers; d,i

2 - Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary.
3 - Handle the following conversion specifiers; u,o,x,y.

4 - Uses a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

5 - Handles the following custom conversion specifier;

S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters).
6 - Handles the following conversion specifie; p.

7 - Handles the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers; +, space, #.

8 - Handles the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers; l, h, Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X.

9 - Handles the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10 - Handles the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11 -Handles the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12 - Handles the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13 - Handles the following custom conversion specifier; r : prints the reversed string.

14 - Handles the following custom conversion specifier; R: prints the rot13'ed string.

15 - All the above options work well together.
